# Trustfy User Guide (v4.3)

## What is Trustfy?

Trustfy is a **non-custodial P2P escrow platform**.

* You trade crypto for fiat directly with another person
* Crypto is locked in a smart contract, not held by Trustfy
* Fiat is sent off-chain using agreed payment methods
* Rules are enforced automatically by code, not by people

No emails, no passwords, no custody of your funds by Trustfy.

## Key Roles Explained Simply

### Maker

* The person who **posts an Ad**
* Can post:

  * **Sell Ad** → “I am selling crypto”
  * **Buy Ad** → “I want to buy crypto”

### Taker

* The person who **takes an existing Ad**
* Fulfills the trade by following the Ad terms

### Arbitrator

* Neutral resolver **only if a dispute happens**
* Cannot steal funds or change rules

## Core Ideas You Must Understand

### 1. Trustfy never holds your money

Crypto is locked in a **smart contract**, not in Trustfy’s wallet.

### 2. Every serious action requires a bond

Bonds exist to stop spam, fake trades, and fake disputes.

### 3. If you act honestly, you lose nothing

If you lie, delay, or abuse the system, you lose money.

---

## Bonds & Fees (Plain Language)

### AdBond (for Ad creators only)

**Who pays?**

* Only the person who posts an Ad

**Why does it exist?**

* To stop spam Ads

**When is it locked?**

* When you create an Ad

**What happens to it?**

* Returned if the trade completes
* Lost if you cancel the Ad or fail your responsibility

---

### DisputeBond (for both buyer and seller)

**Who pays?**

* Both buyer and seller

**Why does it exist?**

* To stop fake disputes and dishonest claims

**When is it locked?**

* Buyer: when taking a trade

## Step-by-Step: How a Trade Works

### Step 1: Creating an Ad (Maker)

You:

* Choose Buy or Sell
* Set amount, price, payment methods
* Lock **AdBond**

Result:

* Your Ad becomes visible to others

---

### Step 2: Taking an Ad (Taker)

You:

* Choose an Ad
* Lock **DisputeBond**

Result:

* The Ad is reserved for you
* Other users can no longer take it

---

### Step 3: Funding the Escrow (Seller)

The seller:

* Locks platform fees
* Locks their **DisputeBond**

Result:

* Crypto is now safely locked
* Buyer is told to pay fiat

---

### Step 4: Paying Fiat (Buyer)

You:

* Send fiat using agreed method
* Click **“Payment Made”**
* Upload proof if needed

Important:

* You must do this within the time window
* Missing the window means losing your DisputeBond

---

### Step 5: Completing the Trade (Seller)

Seller:

* Confirms fiat received
* Releases crypto

Result:

* Buyer receives crypto
* All bonds are returned
* Trade completes successfully

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### If Buyer Does Not Pay on Time

* Buyer loses DisputeBond
* Seller gets crypto back
* Ad reopens

---

### If Seller Does Not Fund Escrow

* Buyer gets DisputeBond back
* Ad may cancel or reopen
* Seller may lose AdBond if responsible

---

## Disputes (Only When Necessary)

### When Can You Open a Dispute?

* Only after buyer has clicked **“Payment Made”**
* Only one dispute per trade

---

### Buyer Can Dispute If

* You paid fiat
* Seller did not release crypto

---

### Seller Can Dispute If

* Buyer clicked “Payment Made”
* Fiat was not actually received

---

### How Disputes Are Resolved

* Arbitrator reviews evidence
* One final decision is made

Outcome:

* Winner gets crypto
* Winner gets DisputeBond back
* Loser loses DisputeBond

No appeals. No overrides.

---
